Key Features

- Dual-Band Operation: Supports both 3.3-3.6 GHz and 4.8-5.0 GHz bands, covering essential 5G frequencies.
- High Isolation: Achieves over 12 dB isolation between antenna elements, reducing interference and improving signal quality.
- Compact Design: Fits within the ultra-thin frames of modern full-screen smartphones, making it suitable for current smartphone trends.
- Optimized for MIMO: Designed with 4x4 MIMO capability, with low Envelope Correlation Coefficient (ECC) for reliable and high-speed data transmission.

  Simulation Results

- Reflection Coefficient: Less than -6 dB in both bands.
- Transmission Coefficient: Maintains below -10 dB in operating frequencies, with a dip around -15 dB.
- Antenna Efficiency: Over 50% in all operational frequencies.

This project demonstrates a high-performance 5G antenna solution that aligns with the latest requirements for high data rates, compact smartphone designs, and reliable MIMOÂ configurations.
